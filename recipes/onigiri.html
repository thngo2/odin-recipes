            <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>In a rice cooker or pot, combine the rice and water. Cook according to the rice cooker's instructions or bring to a boil, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the water is absorbed and rice is tender.</li>
